## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher) and **pnpm**
- **Rust** (latest stable) and **Cargo**
- **Tauri CLI v2**: `cargo install tauri-cli@^2`

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/crapthings/clarity.git
cd clarity

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run in development mode
pnpm tauri dev

# Build for production
pnpm tauri build
```

### Platform-Specific Setup

#### macOS

The app requires **Screen Recording** permission. When you first run the app, macOS will prompt you to grant this permission. You can also grant it manually:

1. Open **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security** → **Screen Recording**
2. Enable **clarity**

#### Windows

The app may require administrator privileges for screen capture depending on your security settings.

#### Linux

On X11 systems, this typically works out of the box. On Wayland, you may need to grant permissions through your desktop environment's settings.

## 📖 Usage

1. **Start Recording**: Click the "Start Recording" button to begin capturing screenshots at 1 FPS
2. **View Timeline**: Navigate to the Trace page to see your activity timeline with AI-generated summaries
3. **Check Statistics**: Visit the Statistics page to see detailed metrics and API usage
4. **Generate Daily Summary**: Go to the Summary page to generate comprehensive daily reports with charts
5. **Configure Settings**: Set up your Google Gemini API key, adjust summary intervals, and customize AI prompts

### First-Time Setup

1. Get a Google Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Open Settings and paste your API key
3. Configure your preferred AI model (default: `gemini-3-flash-preview`)
4. Customize the AI prompt for summaries (supports both English and Chinese)
5. Set your preferred language and video resolution

## 🏗️ Architecture

Clarity is built with modern web technologies:

- **Frontend**: React 19 + Vite + TailwindCSS + BaseUI
- **Backend**: Rust + Tauri v2
- **Database**: SQLite (local storage)
- **AI**: Google Gemini API (File API for video processing)
- **Charts**: Recharts for data visualization
